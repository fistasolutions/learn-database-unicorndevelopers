# Entity-Relationship (ER) Model Basic Concepts

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By the end of this overview, you will understand:
- Basic concepts of ER Model
- Types of entities and attributes
- Relationship types and cardinalities
- Key concepts in ER modeling
- Entity sets and their properties

## 📚 Introduction to ER Model
The ER model defines the conceptual view of a database by:
- Working with real-world entities
- Defining associations between entities
- Providing a good option for database design
- Representing data at view level

## 🔑 Entity Concepts

### What is an Entity?
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Entity] --> B[Real-world Object]
    A --> C[Attributes]
    A --> D[Identity]
    B --> E[Animate]
    B --> F[Inanimate]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Characteristics:**
- Real-world object
- Can be animate or inanimate
- Easily identifiable
- Has attributes/properties

### Entity Set
- Collection of similar entities
- Entities share similar attributes
- May contain overlapping entities
- Example: Students set, Teachers set

## 📊 Attributes

### Types of Attributes
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Attributes] --> B[Simple]
    A --> C[Composite]
    A --> D[Derived]
    A --> E[Single-value]
    A --> F[Multi-value]
    style A fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

1. **Simple Attribute**
   - Atomic values
   - Cannot be divided
   - Example: Phone number

2. **Composite Attribute**
   - Made of multiple simple attributes
   - Example: Full name (first_name + last_name)

3. **Derived Attribute**
   - Calculated from other attributes
   - Not stored physically
   - Example: Age from date_of_birth

4. **Single-value Attribute**
   - Contains single value
   - Example: Social Security Number

5. **Multi-value Attribute**
   - Contains multiple values
   - Example: Phone numbers, Email addresses

## 🔑 Keys in ER Model

### Types of Keys
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Keys] --> B[Super Key]
    A --> C[Candidate Key]
    A --> D[Primary Key]
    B --> E[One or more attributes]
    C --> F[Minimal super key]
    D --> G[Chosen candidate key]
    style A fill:#bfb,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

1. **Super Key**
   - One or more attributes
   - Uniquely identifies entity

2. **Candidate Key**
   - Minimal super key
   - Multiple possible keys

3. **Primary Key**
   - Chosen candidate key
   - Main identifier

## 🔄 Relationships

### Relationship Types
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Relationships] --> B[Binary]
    A --> C[Ternary]
    A --> D[N-ary]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Mapping Cardinalities
1. **One-to-One (1:1)**
   - One entity to one entity
   - Example: Person to Passport

2. **One-to-Many (1:N)**
   - One entity to multiple entities
   - Example: Department to Employees

3. **Many-to-One (N:1)**
   - Multiple entities to one entity
   - Example: Students to Class

4. **Many-to-Many (M:N)**
   - Multiple entities to multiple entities
   - Example: Students to Courses

## 📈 Relationship Sets
- Collection of similar relationships
- Can have descriptive attributes
- Defines degree of relationship
- Shows cardinality

## 📝 Quick Summary
- ER Model represents real-world entities
- Attributes define entity properties
- Keys uniquely identify entities
- Relationships connect entities
- Cardinality defines relationship types

## 🎓 Best Practices
1. Choose appropriate attributes
2. Define clear relationships
3. Use proper cardinality
4. Select suitable keys
5. Maintain data integrity

## ⚠️ Important Notes
- Entities must be identifiable
- Attributes have domains
- Relationships can have attributes
- Cardinality must be defined
- Keys must be unique
