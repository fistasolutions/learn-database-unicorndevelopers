## üìö Introduction to Data Models

### What is a Data Model?
Think of a data model as a blueprint for your database - just like an architect creates a blueprint before building a house. It defines:
- How data is connected (relationships)
- How data is processed (operations)
- How data is stored (structure)
- Relationships between data elements (constraints)

### Why Do We Need Data Models?
1. **Organization**: Helps organize data in a structured way
2. **Communication**: Provides a common language between developers and stakeholders
3. **Efficiency**: Ensures efficient data storage and retrieval
4. **Integrity**: Maintains data accuracy and consistency

## üìä Evolution of Data Models

### 1. Flat Data Models (1960s)
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Flat Data Model] --> B[Single Plane Storage]
    A --> C[Early Implementation]
    A --> D[Basic Structure]
    B --> E[All Data in One Level]
    C --> F[Limited Scientific Approach]
    D --> G[Prone to Anomalies]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Real-World Example:**
```
Name,Age,Class,Subject,Grade
John,15,10A,Math,A
John,15,10A,Science,B
Mary,14,9B,Math,A
Mary,14,9B,Science,A
```

**Problems with Flat Models:**
1. Data Duplication (John's age appears twice)
2. Update Anomalies (changing John's age requires multiple updates)
3. Insertion Anomalies (can't add a new subject without a student)
4. Deletion Anomalies (deleting a student removes all their data)

### 2. Hierarchical Model (1970s)
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Company] --> B[Department1]
    A --> C[Department2]
    B --> D[Employee1]
    B --> E[Employee2]
    C --> F[Employee3]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

**Example:**
```
Company
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ HR Department
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ John (Manager)
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Mary (Assistant)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ IT Department
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Bob (Developer)
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Alice (Designer)
```

### 3. Network Model (1980s)
```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Student] --> B[Course]
    A --> C[Library]
    B --> D[Professor]
    C --> A
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## üîÑ Entity-Relationship (ER) Model

### Basic Concepts
```mermaid
erDiagram
    STUDENT ||--o{ COURSE : takes
    STUDENT {
        string student_id
        string name
        int age
        string email
    }
    COURSE {
        string course_id
        string title
        int credits
    }
```

### 1. Entities
**Definition**: Real-world objects that can be identified uniquely

**Examples:**
- Student
- Course
- Professor
- Department

**Entity Types:**
1. **Strong Entity**: Can exist independently
   - Example: Student, Course
2. **Weak Entity**: Depends on another entity
   - Example: Student's Grade (depends on Student)

### 2. Attributes
**Types of Attributes:**
1. **Simple vs Composite**
   - Simple: Age, Name
   - Composite: Address (Street, City, State)

2. **Single-valued vs Multi-valued**
   - Single: Age
   - Multi: Phone Numbers

3. **Derived vs Stored**
   - Stored: Date of Birth
   - Derived: Age (calculated from DOB)

4. **Key Attributes**
   - Primary Key: Student ID
   - Foreign Key: Course ID in Enrollment

### 3. Relationships
**Types of Relationships:**
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Relationships] --> B[Binary]
    A --> C[Ternary]
    A --> D[Recursive]
    B --> E[One-to-One]
    B --> F[One-to-Many]
    B --> G[Many-to-Many]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## üìà Mapping Cardinalities

### Detailed Examples

1. **One to One (1:1)**
```mermaid
erDiagram
    PERSON ||--|| PASSPORT : has
    PERSON {
        string person_id
        string name
    }
    PASSPORT {
        string passport_number
        string country
    }
```
**Example**: Person to Passport
- Each person has exactly one passport
- Each passport belongs to exactly one person

2. **One to Many (1:N)**
```mermaid
erDiagram
    DEPARTMENT ||--o{ EMPLOYEE : employs
    DEPARTMENT {
        string dept_id
        string name
    }
    EMPLOYEE {
        string emp_id
        string name
        string dept_id
    }
```
**Example**: Department to Employees
- One department can have many employees
- Each employee belongs to one department

3. **Many to One (N:1)**
```mermaid
erDiagram
    STUDENT }o--|| CLASS : belongs_to
    STUDENT {
        string student_id
        string name
        string class_id
    }
    CLASS {
        string class_id
        string name
    }
```
**Example**: Students to Class
- Many students can be in one class
- Each student belongs to one class

4. **Many to Many (M:N)**
```mermaid
erDiagram
    STUDENT }o--o{ COURSE : enrolls
    STUDENT {
        string student_id
        string name
    }
    COURSE {
        string course_id
        string title
    }
```
**Example**: Students to Courses
- One student can take many courses
- One course can have many students

## üìë Relational Model

### Key Features
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Relational Model] --> B[Tables as Relations]
    A --> C[Normalization]
    A --> D[Atomic Values]
    A --> E[Unique Rows]
    A --> F[Domain Values]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Detailed Characteristics

1. **Table Structure**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    age INT,
    class_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (class_id) REFERENCES Classes(class_id)
);
```

2. **Normalization Forms**
   - 1NF: Atomic values
   - 2NF: No partial dependencies
   - 3NF: No transitive dependencies
   - BCNF: Boyce-Codd Normal Form

3. **Data Properties**
   - Atomic values
   - Unique rows
   - Domain-specific columns
   - Referential integrity

## üìä Model Comparison

| Feature | Flat Model | ER Model | Relational Model |
|---------|------------|----------|------------------|
| Structure | Single plane | Entity-based | Table-based |
| Scientific Approach | Basic | Moderate | Advanced |
| Anomalies | High | Moderate | Low |
| Use Case | Simple data | Conceptual design | Implementation |
| Flexibility | Low | High | High |
| Query Complexity | Simple | N/A | Complex |
| Data Integrity | Poor | Good | Excellent |
| Scalability | Limited | Good | Excellent |

## üîç Advanced Concepts

```mermaid
graph LR
    A[Unnormalized] --> B[1NF]
    B --> C[2NF]
    C --> D[3NF]
    D --> E[BCNF]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

        string student_id
        string course_id
        date enrollment_date
        string grade
    }
```
