# SQL Subqueries

## üéØ Learning Outcomes
By the end of this overview, you will understand:
- Types of SQL Subqueries
- Subquery syntax and usage
- Subquery placement
- Performance considerations
- Best practices for nested queries

## üìö Introduction
SQL Subqueries:
- Nested queries
- Support complex logic
- Enable data comparison
- Essential for analysis
- Maintain data integrity

## üìä Types of Subqueries

### 1. Scalar Subquery
- Returns single value
- Used in WHERE clause
- Used in SELECT clause

#### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, (SELECT MAX(column2) FROM table2)
FROM table1;
```

#### Example
```sql
SELECT ProductName, 
       (SELECT MAX(Price) FROM Products) as MaxPrice
FROM Products;
```

### 2. Column Subquery
- Returns single column
- Used in WHERE clause
- Used with IN operator

#### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1
FROM table1
WHERE column1 IN (SELECT column2 FROM table2);
```

#### Example
```sql
SELECT CustomerName
FROM Customers
WHERE CustomerID IN (SELECT CustomerID FROM Orders);
```

### 3. Row Subquery
- Returns multiple columns
- Used in WHERE clause
- Used with comparison operators

#### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1
FROM table1
WHERE (column1, column2) IN 
      (SELECT column1, column2 FROM table2);
```

#### Example
```sql
SELECT ProductName
FROM Products
WHERE (Category, Price) IN 
      (SELECT Category, MAX(Price) 
       FROM Products 
       GROUP BY Category);
```

### 4. Table Subquery
- Returns multiple rows
- Used in FROM clause
- Used as derived table

#### Syntax
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT column1, column2 FROM table1) as alias;
```

#### Example
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT Category, AVG(Price) as AvgPrice 
      FROM Products 
      GROUP BY Category) as CategoryStats;
```

## üîß Subquery Placement

### 1. WHERE Clause
```sql
SELECT column1
FROM table1
WHERE column1 > (SELECT AVG(column1) FROM table1);
```

### 2. FROM Clause
```sql
SELECT *
FROM (SELECT column1, COUNT(*) as count 
      FROM table1 
      GROUP BY column1) as stats;
```

### 3. SELECT Clause
```sql
SELECT column1,
       (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM table2 
        WHERE table2.column1 = table1.column1) as count
FROM table1;
```

### 4. HAVING Clause
```sql
SELECT column1, COUNT(*)
FROM table1
GROUP BY column1
HAVING COUNT(*) > (SELECT AVG(count) 
                   FROM (SELECT COUNT(*) as count 
                         FROM table1 
                         GROUP BY column1) as stats);
```

## üéØ Performance Considerations

### 1. Index Usage
- Use indexed columns
- Consider subquery optimization
- Monitor execution plan

### 2. Subquery Type
- Choose appropriate type
- Consider alternatives
- Evaluate performance

### 3. Data Volume
- Consider result set size
- Use appropriate limits
- Monitor resource usage

## üéì Best Practices
1. Use appropriate subquery type
2. Consider performance
3. Handle NULL values
4. Use clear logic
5. Document queries
6. Test thoroughly
7. Monitor execution
8. Optimize queries

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Errors
- Syntax errors
- Performance issues
- NULL handling
- Index usage
- Data type mismatch
- Logical errors
- Resource limits

## üìù Quick Summary
- Subquery types
- Syntax patterns
- Performance tips
- Best practices
- Error prevention
- Use cases
- Optimization

## üîç Important Considerations
1. Query performance
2. Data accuracy
3. Index usage
4. NULL handling
5. Subquery logic
6. Documentation
7. Testing

## üí° Tips
- Use appropriate subqueries
- Consider performance
- Handle NULL properly
- Use clear logic
- Test thoroughly
- Document process
- Monitor execution
