## üìö Introduction
A Database Management System (DBMS) is a technology that efficiently stores and retrieves user data while maintaining appropriate security measures. This comprehensive tutorial covers essential DBMS concepts including:
- Architecture
- Data models
- Data schema
- Data independence
- E-R model
- Relational model
- Database design
- Storage and file structure

## üéì Why Learn DBMS?
DBMS revolutionized data management by overcoming the limitations of traditional file-based systems. Modern DBMS offers several advantages:

### Key Characteristics
- **Real-world Entity Representation**
  - Uses realistic entities and their attributes
  - Example: School database with students as entities and age as attributes

- **Relation-based Tables**
  - Organizes data in structured tables
  - Clear visualization of database architecture

- **Data-Application Isolation**
  - Separates database system from its data
  - Maintains metadata for efficient operations

- **Reduced Redundancy**
  - Implements normalization rules
  - Scientifically reduces data duplication

- **Consistency**
  - Maintains database consistency
  - Implements methods to detect inconsistencies

- **Query Language Support**
  - Efficient data retrieval and manipulation
  - Advanced filtering capabilities

## üóÑÔ∏è What is a Database?
A database is an organized collection of structured information or data, typically stored electronically in a computer system. Databases are designed to:
- Store and manage large amounts of data efficiently
- Enable quick data retrieval and updates
- Maintain data integrity and security
- Support multiple users and applications

## üìä Types of Databases

### Relational Databases (SQL)

    A --> C[Tables with Relationships]
    A --> D[ACID Compliant]
    A --> E[SQL Query Language]
    B --> F[Rows & Columns]
    C --> G[Foreign Keys]
    D --> H[Transaction Support]
    E --> I[Standardized Queries]
```

**Characteristics:**
- Data organized in tables with rows and columns
- Uses SQL for querying and manipulation
- Follows ACID properties
- Supports complex relationships between data
- Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server

### Non-Relational Databases (NoSQL)
```mermaid
