# Relational Algebra: The Language of Database Queries

## Introduction: Why Relational Algebra Matters
Imagine you're a chef with a set of ingredients (tables) and a recipe book (operations). **Relational algebra** is the recipe book for databases—it tells you how to combine, filter, and transform data to get exactly what you want.

## What is Relational Algebra?
**Relational algebra** is a set of mathematical operations for manipulating and querying data in relational databases. It forms the theoretical foundation for SQL and other query languages.

**Analogy:**
- Tables = Ingredients
- Operations = Recipes

## Core Operations in Relational Algebra

### 1. Select (σ)
- Filters rows based on a condition
- **Example:** Get all students older than 18

### 2. Project (π)
- Selects specific columns
- **Example:** Get only student names and ages

### 3. Union (∪)
- Combines rows from two tables (removes duplicates)
- **Example:** List all unique customers from two regions

### 4. Set Difference (−)
- Rows in one table but not the other
- **Example:** Customers who haven't placed orders

### 5. Cartesian Product (×)
- Combines every row of one table with every row of another
- **Example:** All possible pairs of students and courses

### 6. Rename (ρ)
- Changes the name of a table or column

## Advanced Operations
- **Join:** Combines related rows from two tables
- **Intersection:** Rows common to both tables
- **Division:** Finds rows in one table related to all rows in another
