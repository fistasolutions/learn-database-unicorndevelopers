# SQL GROUP BY Clause

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes
By the end of this overview, you will understand:
- How to group data in SQL
- GROUP BY clause syntax
- Aggregation functions
- HAVING clause usage
- Best practices for data grouping

## 📚 Introduction
GROUP BY Clause:
- Groups rows by columns
- Supports aggregation
- Enables data analysis
- Essential for reporting
- Maintains data integrity

## 🔄 Grouping Process
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Data Grouping] --> B[Group Rows]
    A --> C[Apply Aggregates]
    A --> D[Filter Groups]
    A --> E[Return Results]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## 📊 Basic GROUP BY Syntax
Group data using columns.

### Syntax
```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT Department, COUNT(*) as EmployeeCount
FROM Employees
GROUP BY Department;
```

## 📈 Aggregation Functions

### 1. Basic Aggregates
```sql
-- Count
COUNT(column)

-- Sum
SUM(column)

-- Average
AVG(column)

-- Maximum
MAX(column)

-- Minimum
MIN(column)
```

### 2. Advanced Aggregates
```sql
-- Standard Deviation
STDDEV(column)

-- Variance
VARIANCE(column)

-- Median
MEDIAN(column)

-- Mode
MODE(column)
```

## 🔧 HAVING Clause

### 1. Basic HAVING
```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING aggregate_function(column2) condition;
```

### 2. Multiple Conditions
```sql
SELECT column1, aggregate_function(column2)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING condition1 AND condition2;
```

## 🎯 Common Grouping Patterns

### 1. Basic Grouping
```sql
SELECT column1, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1;
```

### 2. Multiple Columns
```sql
SELECT column1, column2, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1, column2;
```

### 3. With WHERE
```sql
SELECT column1, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
WHERE condition
GROUP BY column1;
```

### 4. With HAVING
```sql
SELECT column1, COUNT(*)
FROM table_name
GROUP BY column1
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
```
