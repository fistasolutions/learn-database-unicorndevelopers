```

## 📊 Basic DELETE Syntax
Delete data from a table.

### Syntax
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition;
```

### Example
```sql
DELETE FROM Customers
WHERE ID = 1;
```

## 📈 Multiple Row Deletion
Delete multiple rows based on condition.

### Syntax
```sql
DELETE FROM table_name
WHERE condition1 AND condition2;
```

### Example
```sql
DELETE FROM Orders
WHERE OrderDate < '2023-01-01'
AND Status = 'Cancelled';
```

## 🔧 Cascading Deletion
Handle related records deletion.

### Syntax
```sql
-- Parent table
CREATE TABLE Parent (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY
);

-- Child table with CASCADE
CREATE TABLE Child (
    ID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    ParentID INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (ParentID) 
    REFERENCES Parent(ID)
    ON DELETE CASCADE
);
```

## 🎯 Data Integrity
Important considerations:
- Referential integrity
- Cascade effects
- Constraint checking
- Transaction handling
- Backup procedures
- Recovery options
- Audit logging

## 🎓 Best Practices
1. Always use WHERE clause
2. Check dependencies first
3. Use transactions
4. Consider cascading
5. Backup data
6. Document operations
7. Test thoroughly
8. Verify results

## ⚠️ Common Errors

- Constraint violation
- Foreign key error
- Permission denied
- Transaction deadlock
- Syntax error
- Resource limits
