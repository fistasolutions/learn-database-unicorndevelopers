# SQL Comments: Documenting Your Database Code

## Introduction: Why Comments Matter
Imagine reading a complex recipe without any notes or explanations. You'd be lost! SQL comments are like recipe notesâ€”they explain what your code does, why it does it, and how it works, making it easier for you and others to understand and maintain.

## What are SQL Comments?
**SQL comments** are non-executable text that helps document your SQL code. They help:
- Explain complex logic
- Document assumptions
- Provide context
- Make code more maintainable
- Guide future developers

## Types of SQL Comments (with Examples)

### 1. Single-Line Comments
```sql
-- This is a single-line comment
SELECT * FROM employees; -- This comment explains the query
```

### 2. Multi-Line Comments
```sql
/* This is a multi-line comment
   It can span multiple lines
   Useful for longer explanations */
SELECT * FROM products;
```

### 3. Inline Comments
```sql
SELECT 
    employee_id,  -- Unique identifier
    first_name,   -- Employee's first name
    last_name,    -- Employee's last name
    salary        -- Annual salary in USD
FROM employees;
```

## Best Practices for Writing Comments

### 1. Document Complex Queries
```sql
/* This query calculates the average salary by department
   and includes only employees who have been with the company
   for more than 1 year */
SELECT 
    department,
    AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM employees
WHERE hire_date < DATE_SUB(CURRENT_DATE, INTERVAL 1 YEAR)
GROUP BY department;
```

### 2. Explain Business Logic
```sql
-- Calculate discount based on customer loyalty
-- Gold members: 20% off
-- Silver members: 10% off
-- Regular customers: 5% off
SELECT 
    order_id,
    total_amount,
    CASE 
        WHEN membership_level = 'Gold' THEN total_amount * 0.8
        WHEN membership_level = 'Silver' THEN total_amount * 0.9
        ELSE total_amount * 0.95
    END as discounted_amount
FROM orders;
```

### 3. Document Schema Changes
```sql
/* Added new column 'last_login_date' to track user activity
   This helps identify inactive accounts for cleanup */
ALTER TABLE users
ADD COLUMN last_login_date DATETIME;
```

    style B fill:#bbf,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: Complex Report Query
```sql
/* Monthly Sales Report
   This query generates a report of monthly sales by product category
   It includes:
   - Total sales amount
   - Number of orders
   - Average order value
   - Year-over-year comparison
   Last updated: 2024-03-15 */
SELECT 
    p.category,
    DATE_FORMAT(o.order_date, '%Y-%m') as month,
    SUM(o.total_amount) as total_sales,
    COUNT(DISTINCT o.order_id) as order_count,
    AVG(o.total_amount) as avg_order_value
FROM orders o
JOIN products p ON o.product_id = p.product_id
GROUP BY p.category, DATE_FORMAT(o.order_date, '%Y-%m')
ORDER BY month DESC, total_sales DESC;
```

### Example 2: Data Migration Script
```sql
-- Step 1: Create temporary table for data validation
CREATE TABLE temp_customers (
    customer_id INT,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);

-- Step 2: Import data from legacy system
INSERT INTO temp_customers
SELECT * FROM legacy_customers;

-- Step 3: Validate data
-- Check for duplicate emails
SELECT email, COUNT(*) as count
FROM temp_customers
GROUP BY email
HAVING count > 1;

-- Step 4: Migrate valid data
INSERT INTO customers (customer_id, name, email)
SELECT customer_id, name, email
FROM temp_customers
WHERE email IS NOT NULL;
```
