# SQL Constraints: The Rules of Data Integrity

## Introduction: Why Constraints Matter
Imagine a library where books can be placed anywhere, with no organization or rules. Chaos would ensue! SQL constraints are like library rulesâ€”they ensure your data stays organized, accurate, and reliable by enforcing specific rules and relationships.

---

## What are SQL Constraints?
**SQL constraints** are rules applied to columns or tables that limit the type of data that can be stored. They help:
- Maintain data accuracy
- Ensure data integrity
- Establish relationships
- Prevent invalid data

## Types of SQL Constraints (with Examples)

### 1. Primary Key
```sql
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    email VARCHAR(100)
);
```
- Uniquely identifies each row
- Cannot be NULL
- Automatically creates an index

### 2. Foreign Key
```sql
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) 
    REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
```
- Links tables together
- Ensures referential integrity
- Prevents orphaned records

### 3. Unique
```sql
CREATE TABLE users (
    user_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    username VARCHAR(50) UNIQUE,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE
);
```
- Ensures no duplicate values
- Can be NULL (unless NOT NULL is specified)
- Can be applied to multiple columns

### 4. Not Null
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL
);
```
- Prevents NULL values
- Ensures required data is provided
- Can be combined with other constraints

### 5. Check
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    age INT CHECK (age >= 18),
    grade CHAR(1) CHECK (grade IN ('A', 'B', 'C', 'D', 'F'))
);
```
- Enforces specific conditions
- Validates data before insertion
- Can use complex expressions

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Database
```sql
CREATE TABLE products (
    product_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    price DECIMAL(10,2) NOT NULL CHECK (price > 0),
    category_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (category_id) REFERENCES categories(category_id)
);

CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    order_date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    total_amount DECIMAL(10,2) CHECK (total_amount >= 0),
    status VARCHAR(20) CHECK (status IN ('pending', 'shipped', 'delivered')),
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
);
```

### Example 2: Student Management System
```sql
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    age INT CHECK (age >= 16 AND age <= 100),
    enrollment_date DATE NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE courses (
    course_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    course_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    credits INT CHECK (credits > 0 AND credits <= 6),
    department_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (department_id) REFERENCES departments(dept_id)
);
```

## Best Practices & Key Takeaways
- Use meaningful constraint names
- Consider performance impact
- Plan constraints before table creation
- Document constraint purposes
- Test constraints with edge cases
- Use appropriate constraint types

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Over-constraining tables
- Forgetting to index foreign keys
- Using too many CHECK constraints
- Ignoring constraint performance
- Not handling constraint violations
