# SQL Statements: The Building Blocks of Database Operations

## Introduction: Why SQL Statements Matter
Imagine you're writing a letter. You need different types of sentences (statements) to ask questions, give instructions, or make requests. SQL statements are like these sentencesâ€”they tell the database exactly what you want to do with your data.

## What are SQL Statements?
**SQL statements** are complete commands that perform specific operations in a database. They help you:
- Retrieve data
- Modify data
- Create or alter structures
- Control access
- Manage transactions

## Types of SQL Statements (with Examples)

### 1. Data Query Language (DQL)
```sql
-- Basic SELECT
SELECT first_name, last_name 
FROM employees 
WHERE department = 'IT';

-- Advanced SELECT with JOIN
SELECT e.name, d.department_name
FROM employees e
JOIN departments d ON e.dept_id = d.id
WHERE e.salary > 50000;
```

### 2. Data Manipulation Language (DML)
```sql
-- INSERT
INSERT INTO customers (name, email) 
VALUES ('John Doe', 'john@example.com');

-- UPDATE
UPDATE products 
SET price = price * 1.1 
WHERE category = 'Electronics';

-- DELETE
DELETE FROM orders 
WHERE status = 'cancelled';
```

### 3. Data Definition Language (DDL)
```sql
-- CREATE TABLE
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- ALTER TABLE
ALTER TABLE products 
ADD COLUMN stock_quantity INT;

-- DROP TABLE
DROP TABLE temporary_data;
```

### 4. Data Control Language (DCL)
```sql
-- GRANT
GRANT SELECT, INSERT 
ON customers 
TO sales_team;

-- REVOKE
REVOKE DELETE 
ON orders 
FROM junior_staff;
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: E-commerce Database
```sql
-- Create product table
CREATE TABLE products (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    price DECIMAL(10,2),
    stock INT
);

-- Insert products
INSERT INTO products (id, name, price, stock)
VALUES 
    (1, 'Laptop', 999.99, 50),
    (2, 'Smartphone', 499.99, 100);

-- Update stock
UPDATE products 
SET stock = stock - 1 
WHERE id = 1;

-- Query low stock items
SELECT name, stock 
FROM products 
WHERE stock < 10;
```

### Example 2: Employee Management
```sql
-- Create employee table
CREATE TABLE employees (
    id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100),
    department VARCHAR(50),
    salary DECIMAL(10,2)
);

-- Grant permissions
GRANT SELECT ON employees TO managers;
GRANT ALL ON employees TO hr_department;

-- Query department summary
SELECT 
    department,
    COUNT(*) as employee_count,
    AVG(salary) as avg_salary
FROM employees
GROUP BY department;
```

## Best Practices & Key Takeaways
- Use consistent formatting
- Include comments for complex statements
- Test statements on sample data first
- Use transactions for multiple operations
- Follow naming conventions
- Consider performance impact

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Forgetting WHERE clauses in UPDATE/DELETE
- Not backing up data before major changes
- Using DDL in production without testing
- Overlooking transaction management
- Ignoring security implications
