# SQL Constraints (Advanced): Mastering Data Integrity and Business Rules

## Introduction: Why Advanced Constraints Matter
Imagine a high-security vault with multiple layers of locks, alarms, and access codes. Advanced SQL constraints are like these extra layers of protectionâ€”they enforce complex business rules, prevent data anomalies, and ensure your database remains trustworthy and robust, even as requirements grow.

## What are Advanced SQL Constraints?
**Advanced SQL constraints** go beyond the basics (PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL, CHECK) to enforce sophisticated rules and relationships. They help:
- Enforce complex business logic
- Maintain referential and domain integrity
- Prevent data anomalies
- Support regulatory compliance
- Automate data validation
- Simplify application code

## Types of Advanced Constraints (with Examples)

### 1. Composite Primary Keys
```sql
-- Composite primary key on two columns
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    enrollment_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);
```

### 2. Composite Unique Constraints
```sql
-- Unique combination of columns
CREATE TABLE employees (
    employee_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    department_id INT,
    email VARCHAR(100),
    UNIQUE (department_id, email)
);
```

### 3. Cascading Actions (ON DELETE/UPDATE)
```sql
-- Foreign key with cascading delete
CREATE TABLE orders (
    order_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES customers(customer_id)
        ON DELETE CASCADE
);

-- Foreign key with cascading update
CREATE TABLE order_items (
    order_item_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (order_id) REFERENCES orders(order_id)
        ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```

### 4. Deferrable Constraints
```sql
-- Deferrable constraint (PostgreSQL example)
CREATE TABLE payments (
    payment_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    order_id INT,
    amount DECIMAL(10,2),
    CONSTRAINT fk_order
        FOREIGN KEY (order_id)
        REFERENCES orders(order_id)
        DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED
);
```

### 5. Domain Constraints (Custom Data Types)
```sql
-- Domain constraint using custom type (PostgreSQL)
CREATE DOMAIN positive_amount AS DECIMAL(10,2)
    CHECK (VALUE > 0);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    amount positive_amount
);
```

### 6. Application-Level Constraints (Enforced via Triggers or Procedures)
```sql
-- Enforcing business rule with trigger
CREATE TRIGGER prevent_duplicate_salary
BEFORE INSERT ON employees
FOR EACH ROW
BEGIN
    IF EXISTS (
        SELECT 1 FROM employees WHERE salary = NEW.salary AND department = NEW.department
    ) THEN
        SIGNAL SQLSTATE '45000' SET MESSAGE_TEXT = 'Duplicate salary in department not allowed';
    END IF;
END;
```

## Real-World Examples

### Example 1: University Enrollment System
```sql
-- Prevent duplicate enrollments
CREATE TABLE enrollments (
    student_id INT,
    course_id INT,
    enrollment_date DATE,
    PRIMARY KEY (student_id, course_id)
);

-- Cascade delete enrollments if student is removed
CREATE TABLE students (
    student_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100)
);

ALTER TABLE enrollments
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_student
FOREIGN KEY (student_id) REFERENCES students(student_id)
ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

### Example 2: Financial Transactions
```sql
-- Enforce positive amounts and deferred checks
CREATE DOMAIN positive_amount AS DECIMAL(10,2)
    CHECK (VALUE > 0);

CREATE TABLE transactions (
    transaction_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    amount positive_amount,
    order_id INT,
    CONSTRAINT fk_order FOREIGN KEY (order_id)
        REFERENCES orders(order_id)
        DEFERRABLE INITIALLY DEFERRED
);
```

## Best Practices & Key Takeaways
- Use advanced constraints for complex business rules
- Document constraint logic and purpose
- Test with edge cases and large data sets
- Monitor constraint performance
- Combine constraints with triggers/procedures as needed
- Review constraints regularly as requirements evolve

---

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- Over-constraining tables
- Ignoring performance impact
- Failing to document complex logic
- Relying solely on application code for validation
- Not testing with real-world scenarios
