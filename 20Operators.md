# SQL Operators

## üéØ Learning Outcomes
By the end of this overview, you will understand:
- Different types of SQL operators
- Operator precedence rules
- How to use operators effectively
- Common operator examples
- Best practices for operator usage

## üìö Introduction
SQL operators:
- Reserved words or characters
- Used in WHERE clauses
- Perform operations and comparisons
- Can be unary or binary
- Specify conditions in statements

## üîÑ Types of Operators

    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

## üìä Arithmetic Operators
| Operator | Description | Example | Result |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| + | Addition | 10 + 20 | 30 |
| - | Subtraction | 20 - 30 | -10 |
| * | Multiplication | 10 * 20 | 200 |
| / | Division | 20 / 10 | 2 |
| % | Modulus | 5 % 2 | 1 |

## üìà Comparison Operators
| Operator | Description | Example | Result |
|----------|-------------|---------|--------|
| = | Equal to | 5 = 5 | TRUE |
| != | Not equal | 5 != 6 | TRUE |
| <> | Not equal | 5 <> 4 | TRUE |
| > | Greater than | 4 > 5 | FALSE |
| < | Less than | 4 < 5 | TRUE |
| >= | Greater than or equal | 4 >= 5 | FALSE |
| <= | Less than or equal | 4 <= 5 | TRUE |
| !< | Not less than | 4 !< 5 | FALSE |
| !> | Not greater than | 4 !> 5 | TRUE |

## üîß Logical Operators
| Operator | Description | Example |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| ALL | TRUE if all comparisons are TRUE | `WHERE salary > ALL (1000, 2000)` |
| AND | TRUE if all conditions are TRUE | `WHERE age > 20 AND salary > 50000` |
| ANY | TRUE if any comparison is TRUE | `WHERE salary > ANY (1000, 2000)` |
| BETWEEN | TRUE if within range | `WHERE salary BETWEEN 1000 AND 2000` |
| EXISTS | TRUE if subquery returns records | `WHERE EXISTS (SELECT * FROM orders)` |
| IN | TRUE if matches list | `WHERE id IN (1, 2, 3)` |
| LIKE | TRUE if matches pattern | `WHERE name LIKE 'John%'` |
| NOT | Reverses boolean value | `WHERE NOT (age > 20)` |
| OR | TRUE if any condition is TRUE | `WHERE age > 20 OR salary > 50000` |
| IS NULL | TRUE if value is NULL | `WHERE phone IS NULL` |
| SOME | TRUE if some comparisons are TRUE | `WHERE salary > SOME (1000, 2000)` |
| UNIQUE | TRUE if no duplicates | `WHERE UNIQUE (SELECT id FROM users)` |

## üìù Operator Precedence
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Operator Precedence] --> B[+, - identity/negation]
    A --> C[*, / multiplication/division]
    A --> D[+, - addition/subtraction]
    A --> E[=, !=, <, >, <=, >=, IS NULL, LIKE, BETWEEN, IN]
    A --> F[NOT logical negation]
    A --> G[AND conjunction]
    A --> H[OR inclusion]
    style A fill:#f9f,stroke:#333,stroke-width:2px
```

### Example
```sql
SELECT 20 - 3 * 5;
-- Result: 5
-- Multiplication (3 * 5 = 15) is evaluated first
-- Then subtraction (20 - 15 = 5)
```

## üéì Best Practices
1. Use parentheses for clarity
2. Understand operator precedence
3. Use appropriate operators
4. Consider NULL handling
5. Test complex expressions
6. Document operator usage
7. Consider performance

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes
- Operators can be unary or binary
- NULL handling is important
- Precedence affects results
- Different RDBMS may vary
- Test expressions thoroughly
- Consider readability
- Document complex logic

## üìù Quick Summary
- Four main categories
- Precedence matters
- NULL handling
- Boolean results
- Complex expressions
- Performance impact
- Regular testing needed
